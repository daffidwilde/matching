The student-allocation problem
==============================

The student-allocation problem (SA) is concerned with the allocation a number of
students to projects that are each led by a supervisor according to some
capacities and preferences. In this kind of problem there are technically three
sets of players, although supervisors and their projects act together as a set
of players.
