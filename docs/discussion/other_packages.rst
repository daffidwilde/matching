Other packages
==============

There exist a number of other packages for completing game theoretic tasks.
Below is a non-exhaustive list of such packages:

Python
------

- `Axelrod <https://axelrod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_: a research library
  aimed at the study of the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma :cite:`KCH+16`.

- `Gambit <http://www.gambit-project.org>`_: a C library with both a Python
  and online interface for the computation of equilibria in large games
  :cite:`MMT14`.

- `Nashpy <https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_: a library for the
  computation of Nash equilibria in two-player, normal form games with a number
  of different algorithms :cite:`KBRK19`.

- `PyNFG <https://pypi.org/project/PyNFG/>`_: a library for modelling network
  form games.


R
---

- `EvolutionaryGames <https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/EvolutionaryGames/
  vignettes/UsingEvolutionaryGames.html>`_: a library for the handling
  evolutionary games, including visualisation for single-population games.

- `gtree <https://skranz.github.io/gtree/>`_: a package for the specification
  of extensive form games that uses Gambit internally.

- `matchingR <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/matchingR/vignettes/
  matchingR-intro.html>`_: a package for the quick computation of algorithms for
  a wide variety of problems including the stable marriage problem, college
  admission problem, and the house allocation problem.
