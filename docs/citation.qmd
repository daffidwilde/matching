If you use `matching` then we would appreciate you citing us in your work.
To do that, you have a couple of options.

## Citing the source code

We maintain a DOI for each version of `matching` on Zenodo.
Please see [our archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2553125)
for the correct citation details. A generic citation is:

```bib
@misc{matching,
    doi = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2553125},
    url = {https://github.com/daffidwilde/matching},
    year = {2019},
    title = {{Matching: A package for solving matching games}},
    author = {{Henry Wilde and Vince Knight}}
}
```

## Citing the paper

The Journal of Open Source Software has published
[a paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02169) on `matching`,
so if you would prefer to cite that, these are the details:

```bib
