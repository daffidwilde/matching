Contributing to the library
===========================

If you are interested in contributing to the Matching library then first of all
we would like to offer our thanks and say welcome!

Whether you're looking to provide a fix for a current `issue
<https://github.com/daffidwilde/matching/issues>`_, report a bug or implement a
new feature to the library, your contributions are always welcome. Pull requests
(PRs) are a good place to discuss contributions so please do not feel you must
present a perfect product from the off.

To make a contribution via a PR, follow these steps:

1. Go to the `GitHub repo <https://github.com/daffidwilde/matching>`_,
   make a fork, and clone the repo locally::

       $ git clone git@github.com/<your-username>/matching.git

2. Assuming you have all the dependencies installed, the next step is to ensure
   that all the tests pass (this should not take very long at all)::

       $ cd matching
       $ pytest tests

3. Make your changes and write tests to go with them -- ensuring they pass, too.

4. Push to your fork and open a pull request.
