Matching requires a Python version of 3.5 or above and relies only on `NumPy
<http://www.numpy.org/>`_ for installation and general use.

The library is most easily installed using :code:`pip`::

    $ python -m pip install matching

However, if you would like to install it from source then go ahead and clone the
GitHub repository before installing locally::

    $ git clone https://github.com/daffidwilde/matching.git
    $ cd matching
    $ python -m pip install .
