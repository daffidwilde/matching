# Summary

- What the library is and how it has been developed
- What a matching game is
- Here's how to use the software in a basic case


# Statement of Need

- Although applications to other fields (social care), universities encounter
  this problem
- Very time-consuming when done by hand; able to compute reasonably large
  instances in very small amounts of time
- Commercial solvers exist; this is open source and allows for reproducible
  results
- Matching can be used as an educational tool for learning about Gale-Shapley
  algorithms
