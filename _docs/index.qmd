## What is `matching`?

The `matching` package is all about solving matching games in Python.

## What is a matching game?

Matching games allow for the allocation of resources and partnerships in a fair
way.
Typically, a game is built around a collection of players and their preferences
over other players.

The objective of the game is to find a mapping in which everyone is
**happy enough** with their match.

## What kind of games can I expect?

In `matching`, we currently deal with the following types of game:

- the stable marriage problem (SM)
- the hospital-resident problem (HR)
- the student-allocation problem (SA)
- the stable roommates problem (SR)
