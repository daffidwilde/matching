title: "What is `matching`?"
---

The `matching` package is all about solving matching games in Python.

# What is a matching game?

Matching games allow for the allocation of resources and partnerships in a fair
way.
Typically, a game is defined by two sets of players that each have
preferences over at least some of the elements of the other set.

The objective of the game is then to find a mapping between the players
in which everyone is **happy enough** with their match.

# What kind of games can I expect?

In `matching`, we currently deal with the following types of game:

- the stable marriage problem (SM)
- the hospital-resident problem (HR)
- the student-allocation problem (SA)
- the stable roommates problem (SR)
