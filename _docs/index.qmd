The `matching` package is all about solving matching games.

Matching games allow for the allocation of resources and partnerships in a fair
way. Typically, a matching game is defined by two sets of players that each
have preferences over at least some of the elements of the other set. The
objective of the game is then to find a mapping between the players in which
everyone is **happy enough** with their match.

In `matching`, we deal with the following types of game:

- the stable marriage problem (SM)
- the hospital-resident assignment problem (HR)
- the student-allocation problem (SA)
- the stable roommates problem (SR)
