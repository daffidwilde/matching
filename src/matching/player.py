class Player:

    Parameters
    ==========
    name : `object`
        An identifier. This should be unique and descriptive.
    pref_names : `list` or `tuple`
        A list, or tuple, ranking the elements of the other set by
        their names.
    capacity : `int`, optional
        The maximum number of matches the player can have at once. If not
        specified, defaults to 1.

    Attributes
    ==========
    matching : `Player` or `list` of `Player` instances
        The current match(es) to the player. This is initialised as `None` or an
        empty list (depending on the type of game) and will remain that way at
        least until the player's game is solved.
