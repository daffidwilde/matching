    respect to one party and is subsequently the worst stable matching for the
    other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    residents : list of Player
        The residents in the game. Each resident must rank a non-empty subset
        of the elements of ``hospitals``.
    hospitals : list of Hospital
        The hospitals in the game. Each hospital must rank all the residents
        that have ranked them.
    optimal : str, optional
        Which party the matching should be optimised for. Must be one of
        ``"resident"`` and ``"hospital"``. Defaults to the former.

    Returns
    -------
    matching : Matching
        A dictionary-like object where the keys are the members of
        ``hospitals``, and the values are their matches ranked by preference.
